# @qnx Monorepo

Welcome to the @qnx monorepository! This collection of libraries is designed to simplify various aspects of web development. Each library serves a specific purpose, providing essential tools for handling HTTP responses, errors, cryptographic tasks and much more.

## Libraries

### @qnx/response

[@qnx/response](https://github.com/yatendra121/qnx/blob/main/packages/response/README.md) is a powerful library tailored for Express.js applications. It streamlines the process of handling HTTP responses with a focus on consistency, validation, and error management.

#### Core Features:

- **Standardized Response Formatting:** Provides a consistent structure for responses, including data, metadata, and errors.
  
- **Validation Support:** Integrates seamlessly with popular validation libraries like Zod and express-validator, making it easy to handle validation errors.

- **No Try-Catch Blocks:** Eliminates the need for try-catch blocks by automatically handling errors and exceptions, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.

- **Error Handling:** Offers built-in support for common error types like 404 (Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error).

- **Type Strong:** Full TypeScript typings support enhances the developer experience and promotes the advantages of static typing.

- **Customization:** Highly customizable, allowing developers to configure response format, error handling, and more.

### @qnx/errors

[@qnx/errors](https://github.com/yatendra121/qnx/blob/main/packages/errors/README.md) is a library focused on providing a consistent and streamlined approach to handling errors in your applications.

#### Key Features:

- **Error Types:** Supports common error types like 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), making error handling more straightforward.

- **Consistent Error Format:** Ensures a standardized format for error responses, facilitating better communication and debugging.

### @qnx/crypto

[@qnx/crypto](https://github.com/yatendra121/qnx/blob/main/packages/crypto/README.md) is dedicated to creating JWE tokens for secure authentication and cryptography.

#### Features:

- **JWE Token Creation:** Provides methods for creating JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens, ensuring secure communication.

- **Authentication Support:** Ideal for generating secure tokens used in authentication processes.

- **Cryptography:** Incorporates cryptographic algorithms to guarantee the secure creation of JWE tokens.
