## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open a private vulnerability report at https://github.com/yatendra121/qnx/security.

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of QNX packages and its official plugins to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
